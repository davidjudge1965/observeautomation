I'm an experienced automation and observability specialist, working with small and large customers in a wide variety of domains to simplify and streamline activities.

Despite my strong technical background, I focus on pragmatic automation — the kind that reduces manual effort, lowers risk, and adds real operational value. 

Over the years, I’ve helped teams automate repetitive tasks, improve observability of hybrid estates, and bring order to legacy systems that others often avoid. Whether it’s developing bespoke scripts, auditing infrastructure for improvement, or providing hands-on expertise during critical projects, I bring a steady, solutions- and value-focused approach to every engagement.

I work as a contractor through my own UK-based service company, and I’m available for short- or medium-term projects - especially where deep infrastructure knowledge and strong scripting or automation skills are needed to unlock progress and deliver value.
