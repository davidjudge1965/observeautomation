# This section holds a portfolio of my work.

This section has examples of my work in Automation.

I share some of the work I've been doign with a focus on showing how it delivers value.  There are some slightly technical bits to show how the result was achieved.

Please reach out to me if:

* Would like help implementing automation/AI in your business
