# This section holds a portfolio of my work.

For the past few months I've been building these 
automations - some of the use AI but many don't - and I'm just super
passionate about automation. 

I'm trying really hard. I want to start a business and I'm
looking to just get some experience with helping people out with my automation/AI systems.

So, do you know anyone who might be interested in AI or might benefit from just having a chat 

I share here some of the work I've been doing with a focus on showing how it delivers value.  There are few slightly technical bits to show how the result were achieved.


Please reach out to me if:
* you have any questions, or 
* you would like a conversation about Automation and AI, or
* Would like help implementing automation/AI in your business.
