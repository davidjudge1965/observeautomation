![me](/image/author.jpg)
I'm an experienced infrastructure automation and observability specialist, working with enterprise customers in a wide variety of domains to simplify and streamline complex IT and business environments.

Over the years, I’ve helped teams automate repetitive tasks, improve observability of hybrid estates, and bring order to legacy systems that others often avoid. Whether it’s developing bespoke scripts, auditing infrastructure for improvement, or providing hands-on expertise during critical projects, I bring a steady, solutions-focused approach to every engagement.

With a strong background across Linux platforms, scripting (Python, Bash), VMware, networking, and tooling such as n8n, Resolve, Ansible and Postman, I focus on pragmatic automation — the kind that reduces manual effort, lowers risk, and adds real operational value. I'm particularly skilled at working within regulated, compliance-driven environments where change needs to be well-documented and carefully managed.

I work as a contractor through my own UK-based personal service company, and I’m available for short- or medium-term projects — especially where deep infrastructure knowledge and strong scripting skills are needed to unlock progress.
