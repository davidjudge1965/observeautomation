# This section described products/services that are available from Observe Automation 
![alt text](/image/ProductsPackagedSolutions.png)

While I've been building automations, some of them can be packaged and implemented quickly for SMBs (and larger organisations too).

Not everyone needs one of my strategy calls and sometimes a small, specific solution can be just what they need.

All the packages are customised and can be extended.

Please reach out to me if:
* you have any questions, or 
* you would like a conversation about Automation and AI, or
* Would like help implementing automation/AI in your business.
