## Why do we need AI Voice Receptionists?
Recent data indicates that nearly 69% of all business enquiries still originate via phone calls yet analyses suggest that 47% of initial calls to UK SMEs go unanswered.

What is the cost of these unanswered calls?  
Mostly it's lost business (i.e. revenue) and how much depends on the business as each business is different.  

Here are a couple examples:

>Florist:

>>Missing approx 10 calls per day.  
>>As typical sales are around £60 per sale, that's up to £600 per day or £1500+ for a 27-day month.


>Plumber/Heating Engineer:

>>Missing calls per day: 4-5  
>>Typical lost revenue per call: £110 - £1200  
>>Using a conservative £175/call, that around £700/day or £1540 for a 22-day month


For both the florist and the plumber, **the monthly lost revenue is significant** and far greater than the cost of an AI Voice Receptionist


## What the AI Voice Receptionist does
At its simplest, the AI Voice Receptionist answers calls for you.
It is trained to speak like you (i.e. the tone of speech, pace, etc., not your actual voice though that is possible).
I knows about your company, products or services and and has access to your calendar.
It can transfer calls to a pre-determined phone number.

Below if a recording of a conversation I had with my voice receptionist.

When the call is finished, the AI Voice Receptionist can send you the transcript of the call.
