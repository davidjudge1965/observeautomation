# This section holds the Homelabbing articles

This section has articles about my efforts and musing on homelabbing.  It is unabashedly technical.

I cover areas such as deploying tools and applications, how I host my own instance of n8n and (soon) many other aspects of setting up, running and managing (with a bit of monitoring) my home lab.

I use my home lab for my own purposes (such as hosting my own n8n in which I run my automations), mainly for learning new products and technologies, but also for (what I consider to be) fun.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
