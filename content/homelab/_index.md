# This section holds the Homelabbing articles

This section has articles about my efforts and musing on homelabbing.  

I cover areas such as deploying tools and applications, how I host my own instance of n8n and (soon) many other aspects of setting up, running and managing (with a bit of monitoring) my home lab.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
