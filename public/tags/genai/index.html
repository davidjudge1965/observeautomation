        <p><p>I spend too long every day labelling (or categorising, if you prefer) the many emails I receive.  There has to be a better way!</p>
<p>An automation could automatically read my emails and decide how to label them for me&hellip; and more</p> </p>

<h1 id="this-section-holds-the-homelabbing-articles">This section holds the Homelabbing articles</h1>
<p>This section has articles about my efforts and musing on homelabbing.  It is unabashedly technical.</p>
<p>I cover areas such as deploying tools and applications, how I host my own instance of n8n and (soon) many other aspects of setting up, running and managing (with a bit of monitoring) my home lab.</p>
<p>I use my home lab for my own purposes (such as hosting my own n8n in which I run my automations), mainly for learning new products and technologies, but also for (what I consider to be) fun.</p> </p>

        <p><p>Using my n8n automations skills and my knowledge of GenAI, I built some automations to save time and focus my job search.  The first automation saves me around 2 to 3 hours of reading job roles every day.</p>
<p>Searching for roles can be very time-consuming especially when the job title you&rsquo;re searching for is a common one which applies to a wide variety of domains as is the case for my job title.</p> </p>

<p>For the past few months I&rsquo;ve been building these
automations - some of the use AI but many don&rsquo;t - and I&rsquo;m just super
passionate about automation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying really hard. I want to start a business and I&rsquo;m
looking to just get some experience with helping people out with my automation/AI systems.</p>
<p>So, do you know anyone who might be interested in AI or might benefit from just having a chat</p> </p>
