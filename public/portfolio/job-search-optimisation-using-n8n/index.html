    <h1> Job Search Optimisation automation using n8n </h1>

    <p>Using my n8n automations skills and my knowledge of GenAI, I built some automations to save time and focus my job search.  The first automation saves me around 2 to 3 hours of reading job roles every day.</p>
<p>Searching for roles can be very time-consuming especially when the job title you&rsquo;re searching for is a common one which applies to a wide variety of domains as my job title does.</p>
<h2 id="summarising-using-genai-and-keyword-search">Summarising (using GenAI) and keyword search</h2>
<p><img alt="Alt" loading="lazy" src="../../portfolio/job-search-optimisation-using-n8n/images/Creating_Snippets_Directory.png"></p>
<p>I use 2 main automations:</p>
<ul>
<li>job analysis workflow</li>
<li>moving applied-to jobs to my tracker</li>
</ul>
<p>The first automation us triggered when I send a job spec to the automation.  The high-level logic is:</p>
<p><img alt="Alt" loading="lazy" src="../../portfolio/job-search-optimisation-using-n8n/images/Jobseeker_Flow_Excalidraw.png"></p>
<p>Any roles that are processed by the automation are stored in a Google Sheet i refer to as my &ldquo;URL&rdquo; sheet.  Using the URL that triggered the automation as the unique key, the sheet is searched to see if it has already been processed and if it has, the automation stops there to save GenAI costs.</p>
<p>If, however, the url is not already in the spreadsheet, the web page for the role is retrieved, passed through to OpenAI for analysis and the analysis is stored in the same Google Sheet.</p>
<p>The analysis step takes the job spec and produces:</p>
<ul>
<li>A precis of the company</li>
<li>Role location</li>
<li>Onsite/hybrid/remote</li>
<li>A summnary of the role</li>
<li>Skills required for the role</li>
<li>Requirements for the role</li>
<li>Does the job spec contains the terms:
<ul>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>AIOps</li>
<li>Observability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To trigger the workflow, as I view the headlines and first paragraph or 2 of a role on LinkedIn (and others), I send the role to the webhook.  I do this using a browser extension which allows me to right-click on a URL and select &ldquo;send to webhook&rdquo; in the drop-down.</p>
<p>I used the &ldquo;URL&rdquo; spreadsheet to look for roles that fit my criteria and when I find one, I click on the link to read the full job spec and maybe apply to the position.</p>
<p>This automation has reduced the number of job specifications I need to read from up to 300 per day to a dozen or two.</p>
<p>For the more technically-minded, here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the actual workflow:

<h2 id="moving-applied-to-roles-to-the-tracker-spreadsheet">Moving applied-to roles to the tracker spreadsheet</h2>
<p>When I have applied for a role, I update my spreadsheet with &ldquo;applied&rdquo; in the appropriate column.</p>
<p>The 2nd automation looks for rows where I have applied, copies them to my tracker spreadsheet and then marks them a &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; in the original spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The workflow runs on a time trigger every day at 8pm automatically.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the logic:

<p>And here&rsquo;s the actual flow from n8n:

<h2 id="what-does-it-cost">What does it cost?</h2>
<p>The n8n server is running on my own homelab, so other than electrity, there&rsquo;s no direct cost for automation.</p>
<p>The analysis of the job role is done by an LLM in the cloud: OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4O-mini (via APIs) which is fast and relatively cheap for this not-very-taxing task.  Each role processed costs less than £0.01 - I don&rsquo;t know exacly how much but my API credit balance goes down very slowly.</p>
