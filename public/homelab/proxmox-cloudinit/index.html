<p>I wanted to build a few VMs for my k8s cluster - a master node which would hold the k8s control plane, and a few worker nodes.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fancy building 4 VMs for my k8s cluster by manually installing the O/S (Ubuntu 24.04) from the ISO and going through the installation GUI when faster and more reliable methods were available.  Enter CloudInit.</p>
<p>Deploying templates to VMs using <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">CloudInit</a> starts with the creation of the VM template.  While this can be done via the Proxmox UI, I chose to use the command-line as much as possible.</p>
<p>To create the template, there are a number of internet resources you can follow.  I based myself on Techno Tim&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shiIi38cJe4">Perfect Proxmox Template with Cloud Image and Cloud Init video</a> though there are a number of very similar videos and blogs.  While the video is around 3 years old, I found it a good base.  Note that Tim also publishes a companion <a href="https://technotim.live/posts/cloud-init-cloud-image/">blog</a> with the details of the commands etc.  However, I find that these resources don&rsquo;t provide enough context or explanations for the commands they use.  As part of my intention in these articles is to educate/explain, this article is somewhat longer and more wordy than the other resources you may read.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, I have compiled some resources that have been useful to me and may be to you.</p>
<p>All the commands below were run as the root user on Proxmox (or &ldquo;pve&rdquo; for Proxmox Virtual Environment).</p>
<h2 id="the-key-steps-are">The key steps are:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the cloud image</li>
<li>Create the new Virtual machine</li>
<li>Import then attach the downloaded CloudInit image to the VM</li>
<li>Add a CloudInit drive to the VM and make it bootable</li>
<li>Add a serial console to the VM</li>
<li>Convert the VM to a template</li>
<li>Configure CloudInit (the parameters, that is)</li>
<li>Clone the template into a new VM</li>
<li>Update the CloudInit configuration in the VM to meet your needs</li>
<li>(Optional) Grow the disk</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="download-the-cloudinit-image">Download the CloudInit image</h3>
<p>A Cloud Init disk image is similar to an ISO file and is the boot/installation disk for our VM.
Canonical&rsquo;s repository of Cloud Init images is <a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/">here</a>.
You will need to download the image that suits you needs.  For me that was:
<a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img">https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img</a>.
Once you&rsquo;ve found the image you want in the repository of cloud images, right-click the file and select &lsquo;Copy link address&rsquo; so that you can paste it into your download command.</p>
<p>To perform the download, use the following command (replacing the URL with your choice of CloudInit image, the one you &lsquo;copied&rsquo; in the previous paragraph) while logged into your Proxmox server as root.  The file will be downloaded in the current directory. You may wish to download it to <code>/var/lib/vz/template/iso</code> (the iso directory of the &rsquo;local&rsquo; storage in Proxmox).  In a later step the downloaded image will be imported into the storage of your choice alongside the VM definition.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="create-the-new-vm-to-later-be-converted-to-a-template">Create the new VM (to later be converted to a template)</h3>
<p>In this process, we first create a VM and later, when we want to use it, we clone it.  It&rsquo;s best practice to convert the VM into a &ldquo;template&rdquo; which protects you from accidentally starting it, etc.  Thus it is the template that we will (later) clone into the actual VM we want.</p>
<p>Pick the values you need for memory, CPU, etc., making sure that the VM ID is unique.  I prefer to use what I think of as minimum usable values.  For my purposes, my k3s control pane node needs 4GiB RAM and 4 vCPU, and the worker nodes will be using the same values, though as their load increases, the RAM and vCPU will probably need to be adjusted.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>qm create <span style="color:#ae81ff">8200</span> --memory <span style="color:#ae81ff">4096</span> --core <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> --name ubuntu-cloud --net0 virtio,bridge<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>vmbr0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This creates a VM with ID 8200, sets the core count to 4, gives it the name &ldquo;ubuntu-cloud&rdquo; and sets the first network interface to use the virtio driver and the <code>vmbr0</code> &lsquo;bridge&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="import-then-attach-the-downloaded-cloudinit-image-to-the-vm">Import then attach the downloaded CloudInit image to the VM</h3>
<p>For it to be used by the VM, the cloudinit image must be imported to the VM and placed in a proxmox storage.  Think of this as converting the downloaded &lsquo;img&rsquo; file into a qcow2 file, Proxmox&rsquo;s preferred format.  On my server, that storage that will hold the resulting qcow2 file is called &ldquo;data4tb&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The  commands are below - The bolded text needs to be adapted for your environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img&rdquo; is the file name from the wget command which will be imported into the Proxmox VM as &lsquo;vm-8200-disk-0&rsquo;&hellip; It&rsquo;s disk number 0 of VM id 8200.</p>
<p>The cloudinit disk images are just big enough.  This means that once it&rsquo;s up and running you won&rsquo;t have enough disk space to store very much.  In my testing I failed to install more than 2 or 3 packages as the VM ran out of space.  To alleviate this issue, the commands include growing the disk.  Doing it at this stage has the benefit that at first start, the filesystem will expand to fill the disk.  The &lsquo;resize&rsquo; command tells pve to grow the disk so if it was 3Gbytes to start with the command below will give you a disk of 53Gb.</p>
<p>The last command sets the boot order to contain just one disk, the one attached to scsi0.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>qm disk import <span style="color:#ae81ff">8200</span> noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img **data4tb**

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>qm resize <span style="color:#ae81ff">8200</span> scsi0 +50G
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>qm create --boot order<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>scsi0
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="add-a-cloudinit-drive-to-the-vm">Add a Cloudinit &lsquo;drive&rsquo; to the VM</h3>
<p>The cloudinit drive (usually an ISO file - pve will (re-)generate it for you) contains the parameters for the cloudinit operation that will take place when the VM boots.
The parameters/values can be set in the Proxmox GUI and this is done later in this process:
<img alt="Alt" loading="lazy" src="../../images/VM_Cloudinit_parameters.png"></p>
<p>Note that the first command will create the cloud-init disk - though it&rsquo;s actually an ISO file rather than a generic disk.  It will output the progress of the creation of the disk.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>qm set 8200 --ide2 **data4tb**:cloudinit
</code></pre><h3 id="add-a-serial-console-to-the-vm-and-enable-guest-agent">Add a serial console to the VM and enable Guest Agent</h3>
<p>This step is needed to enable you to view boot output, etc. via Proxmox&rsquo;s Console function (VNC - a virtual remote/screen).</p>
<p>If you you don&rsquo;t plan on adding some SSH keys, this step is vital.  Without it, in the absence of SSH keys, you won&rsquo;t be able to log in even from the pve console.</p>
<p>By default, pve does not try to talk to the guest agent on VMs.  I recommend switching that on as it gives visibility in the GUI to the VM&rsquo;s networking which is very useful, especially when the network was set up for DHCP.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>qm set 8200 --serial0 socket --vga serial0
qm set 8200 --agent enabled=1
</code></pre><h3 id="convert-the-vm-to-a-template">Convert the VM to a template</h3>
<p>While you can clone a VM, it&rsquo;s best practice to create a template (as mentioned above) which you configure as needed and to then clone the template to a VM when you need a VM.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>qm template 8200
</code></pre><h3 id="configure-cloudinit-the-parameters-that-is">Configure CloudInit (the parameters, that is)</h3>
<p>In Cloudinit images, the cloudinit process which is executed on every start of a cloudinit VM takes its configuration from the configuration data stored in the cloudinit disk we created earlier.  This section explains how to populate that disk with the custom configuration we need.</p>
<p>You can manually configure the cloudinit parameters using the GUI as mentioned earlier.  However the intent of this article is to document the steps you will need to create the VMs using just the command line so that, in time, we can automate the process via a script or an automation tool.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of cloudinit can be configured individually on the command-line.  e.g. you can set the ssh key to the contents of a file thus: <code>qm set 8200 --sshkey ~/.ssh.id_rsa.pub</code> which will set the cloudinit SSH key to the contents of the id_rsa.pub (the public key) from the .ssh directory of the user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>
<p>I need to be able to ssh into the VMs from multiple different places: my &lsquo;home&rsquo; computer, the Proxmox server&rsquo;s CLI and from my Ansible server and for this I need set the cloudinit SSH Key to contain all three keys.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to update the &lsquo;user&rsquo; section of cloudinit which includes configuration of the user, their password, and other parameters including the various ssh keys that will be needed.  Note that you only deploy the public keys!  And it&rsquo;s best practice not to set a password for the user which, in effect, enforces the more secure use of SSH keys to log in remotely.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to create a yaml configuration file.  For my example, the yaml file will look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#cloud-config</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">package_upgrade</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">true</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The user-data configuration can be used for much more - later in this article you will see how I configured it to install the package <code>qemu-guest-agent</code> and start it - see the &lsquo;packages:&rsquo; and &lsquo;runcmd:&rsquo; sections of the user configuration a little further down.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-cloudinit-custom-configuration-files">Configuring cloudinit custom configuration files</h3>
<p>Cloudinit allows you to use configuration files that are read by cloudinit at startup.  While there are 4 different areas or sections in cloudinit (user, network and meta, vendor), I will only need to customise 2 of them: user and network.</p>
<p>You can then use the yaml files for user and network to configure these aspect of cloudinit.</p>
<p>These configuration files must reside on a PVE filesystem configured to contain snippets.  The next few paragraphs cover the creation of a directory in the pve GUI to hold the snippets.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that once you are using cicustom files, changes via the GUI to the cloudinit configuration will have no effect ad the contents of the configurations will take precendence.</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-snippets-directory">Creating a snippets directory</h4>
<p>The cloudinit configuration yaml files must be stored in a location that can be reached when the VM is starting - i.e. in a pve storage location.  To be able to create a snippet, you will first need to add a &ldquo;snippet&rdquo; storage if you haven&rsquo;t got one. To do this, in the Proxmox GUI, select your storage view and add a &lsquo;directory&rsquo; storage:
<img alt="Alt" loading="lazy" src="../../images/Creating_Snippets_Directory.png"></p>
<p>I created a storage called &ldquo;snip&rdquo; and gave it a the following location in the pve&rsquo;s filesystem: <code>/snipfiles</code>.  When the snippet location is created it creates a &ldquo;snippets subfolder in &ldquo;/snipfiles:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root@pve:/# tree snipfiles/
snipfiles/
└── snippets

2 directories, 0 files
</code></pre><p>Thus &ldquo;/snipfiles/snippets&rdquo; will be the folder in the pve&rsquo;s filesystem where I will place snippets on my pve server.</p>
<p>Proxmox (or cloudinit) does not seem to like subdirectories in the snippets.  You must create the configuration files in the snippets directory (i.e. <code>/snipfiles/snippets</code>).</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-configurations-file-snippets">Creating the configurations file &ldquo;snippets&rdquo;</h4>
<p>While there are 4 different areas or sections in cloudinit (user, network and meta, vendor), I will only need to customise 2 of them: user and network.</p>
<p>You can then use the yaml files for user and network to configure these aspect of cloudinit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create the two files.
First the file for the user section which contains the hostname/FQDN, user, SSH keys and other parameters:</p>

<p>You can verify the full reference/path of the configuration files (what the pve documentation calls <code>volume</code>) you just created with the command <code>pve list snip</code> where &ldquo;snip&rdquo; is the name of the storage:</p>

<p>The next command will configure cloudinit for our template with the 2 sections we created above.  The command I will reference the snippets using the &ldquo;snippets&rdquo; storage reference <code>snip:</code> (as displayed by the <code>pvesm list</code> command).</p>

The snippets are read/used when the VM is created.</p>
<p>You can also use this command on a cloudinit <em>VM</em> (as opposed to a template) - i.e. once you&rsquo;ve cloned the template.  The changes will take effect next time you start the VM.</p>
<p>While it is not possible today to view the cloudinit settings you have set in the GUI, you can check the VM/template&rsquo;s config file.  For the 8200 template, look at the content of <code>/etc/pve/qemu-server/8200.conf</code>.  You will see the following line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cicustom: user=snip:snippets/user-data.yaml,network=snip:snippets/network-data.yaml
</code></pre><p>To create the 4 VMs that started this article, I will eventually create 4 separate sets of config files and will prefix the filename with the hostnamename or id of the node - e.g. for the 3rd worker node, I would copy  user-data.yaml to kworker_<em>3</em>_-user-data.yaml and then customise it.</p>
<h3 id="clone-the-template-into-a-new-vm">Clone the template into a new VM</h3>
<p>Here we clone the template to a new VM with ID 210 (which must be an available ID), making a full clone (independent from the template) and placing it in the &lsquo;data4tb&rsquo; storage.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>qm clone <span style="color:#ae81ff">8200</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">210</span> --full true --storage data4tb
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>All that&rsquo;s left to do is start the VM</p>
<h1 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h1>
<p>The process of creating the VMs for my k3s cluster can now start.  My next step will be to write a script to take the &ldquo;base&rdquo; cloudinit data files and copy them to <code>hostname</code>-user-data.yaml and <code>hostname</code>-network-data.yaml and to customise them with data secific to the new vm such as hostname, fqdn and IP address.</p>
<p>I think I will porbably write an article about that as I suspect not everyone knows the techniques that can be used to make this easy.  Watch this space.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve made it this far, many thanks for your perseverance.  If you&rsquo;ve found this useful, please let me know - either comment where you found the link (probably a LinkedIn post, or maybe my github), and maybe a like if you think the article is worthy of one.</p>
