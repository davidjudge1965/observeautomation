    <p>War is one of humanity’s darkest realities, leaving behind destruction, pain, and broken lives.</p>
<p>Throughout history, wars have been fought over power, resources, and ideology, but the cost has always been heavy. Entire cities have crumbled, families have been torn apart, and countless lives have been lost. While war is often remembered for its battles, it also teaches us the true value of peace. In today’s world, it stands as a reminder that dialogue and unity must always be chosen over violence.</p>
