|---|---|---|---|

| `/about/` | — | `layouts/about/single.html` | Circular photo + content |
| `/contact/` | — | `layouts/contact/single.html` | Form + GDPR notice |

### Navigation order
Home · Products · Services · Portfolio · Blog · Homelab · About · Contact

### Key layout pattern
All section list pages share the same structure:
1. Hero image with title overlay (uses `image` and `hero_position` front matter)
2. Intro text from `_index.md` content
3. Card grid iterating `.Pages`
4. Two signpost CTA cards at the bottom

### `hero_position` front matter param
Controls `background-position` on hero images. E.g. `hero_position: "center top"` prevents heads being cropped. Defaults to `center` if omitted.

## Pricing model

### AI Voice Receptionist (Florist and Trades)
- **Setup fee**: £500 (one-off)
- **Monthly management fee**: from £200/month
- **Call/AI costs**: Passed through at cost — £0.13/min, ~2.5 min avg = ~£0.33/call
- **Minimum contract**: 3 months, then rolling monthly

### Late Payment Chasing
- **Setup fee**: £350 (one-off)
- **Monthly management fee**: £100/month (up to 20 invoice reminders)
- **No per-transaction AI costs**
- **Minimum contract**: 3 months, then rolling monthly

- **AI costs**: £0.01–£0.10 per email, passed through at cost
- **Minimum contract**: 3 months, then rolling monthly

### General principles (applies to all products)
- All products run on **customer-owned infrastructure**: customer has their own Hetzner (or equivalent) VPS and their own API accounts (Twilio, VAPI, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.). ObserveAutomation does not host on shared hardware — this is against n8n's terms of service for self-hosted multi-tenant deployments.
- **Workflow IP belongs to ObserveAutomation**. Customers receive a non-transferable licence to use the workflow in their own business indefinitely, including after the engagement ends. They may not share, sell, or sublicense the workflow.
- AI/API costs are always passed through at cost, with no markup, on the customer's own provider bills.

## Target market

Primary audience: **any SMB owner** spending time on tasks that could be automated. The site positioning is "AI and automation for small businesses" — not receptionist-specific.

Key verticals with specific product fit:
- **Florists** — AI Voice Receptionist; standard order £50, weddings £thousands, funerals £600–£1,000
- **Trades** — AI Voice Receptionist; plumbers, electricians, heating engineers (£110–£1,500 per job)
- **Any business that invoices clients** — Late Payment Chasing
- **Any SMB owner with a busy inbox** — Email Triage
- **Salons and pet services** — booking-dependent, good fit for Voice Receptionist
- **Independent retailers** — automation consulting and bespoke builds

## Content and tone guidelines

- **Products/portfolio/blog**: Write for sceptical small business owners. Lead with pain and cost, not features. Concrete £ figures. No jargon.
- **Sentence length**: Vary sentence length within paragraphs. A single short sentence lands hard after a longer one — but never open a paragraph with multiple consecutive short sentences or fragments. Complete sentences always; fragments only in H2 callout headers.
- **Homelab**: Unabashedly technical. Audience is fellow tinkerers and organisations evaluating technical depth.
- **British English always**: "organise" not "organize", "recognise" not "recognize", "colour" not "color", etc.
- **No em-dashes** (—): use a comma, colon, or restructure the sentence instead.
- **Positioning line**: "I remove manual work and reduce costs by automating bottlenecks." — use as an opener on about, services, and homepage.
- Audio demo: `static/media/OA_Receptionist_Example_Call.mp3` — always link on receptionist product pages
- Audio shortcode: `{{< audio-player src="media/OA_Receptionist_Example_Call.mp3" title="Hear the AI receptionist in action" >}}`

- **Google Business Profile**: Fix primary category ("IT support and services" is not accurate)
- **Homelab articles**: Review content and layout — user needs to create artefacts first
- **"Monitoring n8n in my lab"**: Needs a better hero image (AI-generated image prompt available)
- **Schema**: Add phone number and full address when test number is retired
- **SEO**: Meta descriptions for new Email Triage product page and updated homepage/services descriptions should be re-validated in Search Console after indexing
